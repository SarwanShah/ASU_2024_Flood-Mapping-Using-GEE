# üåä Flood Mapping and Impact Assessment Using Google Earth Engine  

## üìå **Project Overview**  
This project was developed as part of the **SES 598 Cloud-Based Remote Sensing** course at **Habib University**, led by **Instructor Jiwei Li**. It leverages **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** to map flood events and assess their impacts on urban and agricultural land. Using satellite data from **Sentinel-1 SAR** and **MODIS**, the application enables near-real-time flood detection and impact analysis, empowering decision-makers in flood-prone areas to take informed actions.

## üåç **Project Motivation**  
The frequency of extreme weather events, such as flooding, has increased due to climate change. A striking example was the **2022 Pakistan floods**, which submerged one-third of the Sindh province. This project aims to provide a scalable solution to quickly map and assess flood impacts, helping communities prepare and respond to future events.

## üõ† **Project Features**  
- **Flood Mapping**:
  - Utilizes **Sentinel-1 SAR** (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data with high spatial resolution (10m), capable of capturing flood events even under cloud cover.
  - Supports before-and-after analysis using user-defined date ranges.

- **Impact Assessment**:
  - Integrates **MODIS** land cover data to analyze flood effects on urban and crop land.
  - Generates statistics such as total flooded area and percentage of affected regions.

- **Speckle Noise Reduction**:
  - Applies a **Refined Lee Speckle Filter** to enhance image clarity by reducing radar noise.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Dynamic input panels for region selection, date inputs, and analysis parameters.
  - Customizable thresholds for flood and terrain filtering.

- **Visualization and Outputs**:
  - Displays flood extent, impacted urban/crop areas, and a detailed legend.
  - Outputs key statistics for decision-making.

## üîß **How It Works**  
1. **Select Region**: Choose a country and state using administrative boundaries from the FAO GAUL dataset.  
2. **Define Timeframes**: Specify "before" and "after" flood event date windows.  
3. **Run Analysis**: The app processes Sentinel-1 and MODIS satellite data to detect flooded regions.  
4. **View Results**: Visual maps and statistical outputs appear on the interface, highlighting affected areas.
